Python variables work as pointers to objects.

    i.e  they aren't restricted to a specific type and can be assigned dynamically. (duck typing)
    variables are not declared its assigned
    in short think of a variable as a name for an object.


Rules

    can consist of upper and lowercase letter, the digits 0-9 and the underscore character.
    the first character of a variable cannot be a digit
    reserved keywords should not be used as variable names.
    are case-sensitive


Conventions as Defined in PEP8

    use snake_case for variable names (instead of CamelCase)
    Don't use names that look like the digits 1 and 0 example lowercase L
